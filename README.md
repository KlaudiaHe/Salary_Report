This project investigates the key factors contributing to the top quartile of salaries in the data science field, using a dataset from Kaggle's 2023 Data Science Salaries. The analysis explores the relationships between salary and various factors such as experience level, job title, company size, geographic location, and remote work ratio.

Through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and advanced techniques like K-means clustering and PCA, the project uncovers significant salary variations across different roles and regions. Senior experience levels, specialization in machine learning, and working in North America are identified as strong predictors of higher salaries. The findings provide valuable insights for both data science professionals and organizations looking to optimize compensation strategies in this evolving field.
